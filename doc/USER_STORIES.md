# User Stories
- User 1: Researcher who has generated a scRNAseq dataset. They want to know which clustering method yields the most signifigant differences between cluster means and wants to know that the differences they are seeing are real (not due to inflated type 1 error). They are fairly technical but may not be well versed in software, probably won't change software tool.

- User 2: Data scientist behind the tool, consultant that consults with researchers using the tool and adds features researchers need on a case by case basis. Highly technical.

- User 3: Statistician who is not interested in looking at their own data but is interested in why the different methods are generating different p values. Want to know how the method works but won't go and edit the code.
